### Project Title:
**"Predicting Mobile Phone Price Range Using Machine Learning"**

### Project Explanation:
In the rapidly evolving mobile phone market, pricing a device appropriately is crucial for manufacturers to remain competitive. This project aims to develop a predictive model to classify mobile phones into different price ranges based on their features. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, specifically Logistic Regression, the project analyzes various technical specifications of mobile phones to predict their corresponding price category.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Two datasets are used - one for training the model and one for testing its accuracy. Each dataset contains various features of mobile phones such as battery power, clock speed, RAM, and screen size.
   
2. **Feature Selection**: Independent variables like battery power, blue, clock speed, dual sim, and others are considered to predict the dependent variable, `price_range`.

3. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression is applied to the training data to develop a classification model. The model is trained to understand the relationship between the phone features and their price range.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is tested using the test dataset. Key performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are used to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

5. **Insights and Applications**: The resulting model can help manufacturers and retailers understand which features most significantly impact the price range of mobile phones. This information can be used for strategic pricing, product development, and marketing strategies.

### Conclusion:
By accurately predicting the price range based on mobile phone features, businesses can make data-driven decisions that enhance their market positioning and meet consumer expectations more effectively. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world business challenges in the technology sector.
